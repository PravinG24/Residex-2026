TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION: THE REX ENGINE
How the system decides what to show.
The Sorting Algorithm:
The dashboard creates a Priority Queue based on a weighted score for each active card.
1.	Safety & Legal (Weight: 100): Tribunal Votes, Water Cuts, Fire Alarms.
2.	Financial Deadlines (Weight: 80): Rent Due, Overdue Bills.
3.	Behavioral Friction (Weight: 60): Incoming Nudges, Chore Deadlines.
4.	Routine Maintenance (Weight: 40): Usage Alerts, Ticket Updates.
5.	Social/Positive (Weight: 20): Badges, Events.
Example: If "Rent is Overdue" (Score 80) and a "Nudge" arrives (Score 60), the Rent Card stays big (Hero), and the Nudge Card slides underneath (Deck).
