Phase 1 — Survival / Core Revenue (Non-Negotiable)

These keep the app alive. If these aren’t working, nothing else matters.

Recurring group bills

Fully automated creation, splitting, and tracking

Must handle variable members, amounts, and dates

Payment initiation (multi-wallet)

DuitNow, GrabPay, TnG, MAE deep-links

One-tap or copy-paste payment request

Must never hold money (avoid BNM/legal headaches)

Auto-settlement / “Pay All”

One action clears multiple debts

Reduces payment fatigue

Optional convenience fee for revenue

Proof-of-payment / confirmation

Supports payments outside app (cash, bank, e-wallet screenshots)

Dual confirmation updates trust scores

Prevents disputes

Immutable history / archived groups

Prevent loss of data when someone leaves

Allows exports if you plan Pro tier

🟢 Phase 2 — Habit & Retention (High Value)

These make users come back repeatedly. They don’t generate revenue by themselves, but they amplify it.

Debt simplification / netting

Minimize the number of transfers per group

Must be clear, visually simple

Pre-saved groups / templates

Quick setup for recurring groups (roommates, clubs)

Soft late-payment reminders / trust score

Gentle escalation: Friendly → Neutral → Visible pending → Trust impact

Optional toggle per group

Monthly statements / expense snapshots

“You paid RM432 this month, owes RM120”

Helps people see real value

Can be Pro tier feature

Non-user pay flow

Let people pay even if they haven’t installed the app

Increases adoption / reduces friction

🟡 Phase 3 — Gamification / Engagement

These are your fun, viral features. They amplify retention but don’t solve survival.

Ranks / badges / titles

Optional display per group

Must be culturally relevant / humorous

Trust score + leaderboard

Only visible within group or opt-in globally

Social pressure without shaming

Cosmetics / animations / seasonal flair

Free for engagement, optional paid bundle

Should never be core revenue

Funny roasts / lore / local references

Shareable, meme-able

Keeps app culturally sticky

Global ranking / “Master Splitter” badges

Optional for viral screenshots / social sharing

Reinforces identity & fun
