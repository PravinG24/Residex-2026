Tiered Monetization Strategy
1️⃣ Core Revenue — Payment-Linked Fees (Primary)

Why this works: People are willing to pay a tiny fee to save effort and avoid hassle. This is your main source of income.

Implementation options:

Model	How it works	Notes
Convenience fee	RM0.20–RM0.50 per successful settlement	Invisible to most users; can be split among group members
“Pay All” premium	Free to view debts; one-tap settlement for a small fee	Perfect for recurring roommates / clubs
Optional payment prioritization	Charge for ordering multiple payments by priority	Adds value to frequent users

Key point: You never hold money, you just generate revenue from payment facilitation. Low risk, legal-safe, and scalable.

2️⃣ Subscription — Pro Tier (Secondary)

Why this works: Some users (especially roommates or clubs) want convenience and history. They’ll pay if it saves them effort.

Suggested Pro features:

Unlimited recurring groups

Unlimited receipts / OCR scans

Monthly statement exports (PDF / CSV)

Advanced debt simplification

Soft late-payment automation

Optional cosmetic/gamification perks bundled

Price idea (Malaysia): RM8–15/month or RM80–120/year.

People pay for effort saved, not badges. Make cosmetics a bonus, not the reason.

3️⃣ Cosmetics / Gamification (Tertiary / Optional)

Why this works: Fun & viral, but revenue will be minor unless bundled.

Animated badges, seasonal flair, rank effects

Could be free for Pro users

Optional standalone micro-purchase: RM2–RM5 for cosmetic packs

Keep it optional; must never be core revenue

Think of it like icing on the cake. It increases retention, indirectly boosting primary revenue.

4️⃣ Optional B2B / Club Targeting (Advanced)

Clubs, societies, or student associations may pay for admin features:

Role-based groups (treasurer/admin tools)

Exportable statements

Recurring templates

Could charge per group per month instead of individual users

This is optional but lucrative if you capture the right niche early.

⚡ Key Principles

Revenue comes from pain, not fun.

Users pay to reduce friction, not for a funny badge.

Bundle gamification smartly.

Cosmetics + fun = retention

Never sell it standalone at launch

Start lean, test the fee.

Roll out with 1 wallet + “Pay All” convenience fee first

Measure conversion and adoption before adding Pro tier or cosmetics

Avoid subscription-first pitfalls

Malaysia is price-sensitive

Free tier must feel complete, Pro tier is premium convenience

💡 Revenue funnel recap:

User splits bills → uses auto-settlement / multi-wallet → tiny fee (primary)

High-frequency / heavy-use groups upgrade to Pro → subscription (secondary)

Cosmetic flair + gamification → optional micro-purchase (tertiary, bonus)
